## Bitcoin addresses and their corresponding private key can be conveniently generated in a web browser. You can load the JavaScript locally and trust that the JavaScript did not change after being loaded.

### END USER NOTES:

 1. For Bulk Wallet I recommended using Google Chrome, it's the fastest.

 2. Requires IE9+, Firefox, Chrome or sufficient JavaScript support.

 3. Mobile Safari only worksjust type into the text box until reaches 100%

 4. DO NOT use Opera or anything that JavaScript outputs server side as it might record the private key you generated.

 5. Download the Zip and use the tool offline for Garunteed privacy
